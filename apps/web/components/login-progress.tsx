// the overview's own query — ~4 s warm, up to ~12 s when the function is cold — so four seconds is past
// the warm case and the extra line only appears when something really is slow.
//
// `authenticating` gets a threshold too, and it matters more than its short warm time (~1 s) suggests:
// supabase-js sets no timeout on the sign-in request, so a dropped connection or a captive portal leaves
// it pending forever, and the form underneath is `inert` and covered. Without this line the user would
// stare at "Checking your credentials…" with no hint that reloading is the way out.

// a live region has to already be in the DOM when its content changes for the change to be announced
